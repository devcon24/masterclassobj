In this project you will find:
 - A Site Initializer Client Extension evolving the current MasterClass Site Initializer in Liferay DXP
 - A Batch Client Extension to create Objects as the base for Courses, Teachers, Enrollment, etc.
 - Additional Front End Client Extensions JS / CSS to complete the different use cases.
 
 The code itself has two branches:
  - Master: this is the final code, that represents this example in a complete way
  - DevCon: this is a branch where part of the example is not complete so we can use this starting point as a workshop in Liferay Devcon 2024 (or you yourself, apart from Devcon at your own peace)
 
 There's also two releases:
  - Complete release: the different CX ZIPs already compiled to be deployed as CXs both in Cloud and SH Liferay DXP installations. 
  - Devcon release: the same CX ZIPs but in the intermediate state to be completed during a workshop in Liferay Devcon 2024
